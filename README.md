# Packet Sniffer with Live Graphical Output

A basic packet sniffer program that captures network packets and provides a live graphical output, showing the number and type of packets in both a line graph and a pie chart.

## Description
This project allows users to capture network packets in real-time and visualize the data. The packet sniffer displays the number and type of packets captured using:
- A **Line Graph** to show the packet count over time.
- A **Pie Chart** to show the distribution of different types of packets.

The program uses **PyShark** for Wireshark integration and **Matplotlib's Pyplot** for graphical representation.
